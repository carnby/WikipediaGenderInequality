This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks (in Python 2.7) that perform notability and lexical analysis on biographies
present in DBpedia and Wikidata, according to gender.

Install the required libraries in `requirements.txt` (you can use pip).
You also need:

  * [DBpedia Utils](https://github.com/carnby/dbpedia_utils) to iterate over DBpedia data (this is mandatory).
  * [matta](https://github.com/carnby/matta) to generate word clouds of lexical analysis results (optional). 

Code by [Eduardo Graells-Garrido](http://carnby.github.io) for a joint paper with [Claudia Wagner](http://claudiawagner.info/) and [David Garc√≠a](http://dgarcia.eu/).
